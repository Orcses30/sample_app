Scene 1 - Intro

Our story takes us to a land far away,

Where all kinds of animals live and play.

There are guardians in the land who are wise and strong,

Who watch over the animals and help them get along.



But one guardian is misunderstood,

Feeling alone in her home nestled in a 100-acre wood.

Loving the animals she is pledged to protect,

But yearning for more than she has come to expect.



Let us go now to this guardian’s home,

Where at this moment she doesn’t feel so alone.

Singing with bluebirds, sparrows and robins,

Our adventure is about to begin.



Scene 2   - Robins Report

The sun is out, flowers are blooming,

Bees are buzzing, nightingales are crooning.

Enjoying her garden after a long spell of rain,

A sparrow flies towards her and calls her by name.



“Miss Sarah! I flew here as fast as I could,

Two baby elephants have wandered into your 100 acre-wood.

I do not know where they came from or where they are going.

They seem to be lost and have no way of knowing,

The dangers of this forest and what to be avoiding.



Scene 3 - Sarah Enlists Diglet

On a safe, level surface with no bugs or rocks,

Diglet the Brave was playing with foam blocks.

“What a fine day where I can lay in the sun,

And pass the time away having safe fun.”



Startled, Diglet looked up from his blocks when Sarah called his name.  

She seemed hurried, and foregoing pleasantries quickly exclaimed,

“Two baby elephants are wandering in our hundred-acre wood.

They are lost and all alone, their situation is not good!”



“I will help you find them, you can count on me.

I am not afraid of anything.” He said unconvincingly.

"Thank you Diglet, now let’s hurry and travel west.

We must find those baby elephants before the sun sets."



Scene 4 - River Crossing

Diglet and Sarah had not travel far before,

they came across Jim Beaver and Anne Eyore.

“We are on a heroic adventure!” Diglet boldly claimed.

Jim Beaver snorted “I haven’t the time for playing games.

There are trees to be felled and dams to maintain.”

Jim Beaver exclaimed “Work first get it done, work last, have more fun.”



“We are searching for two baby elephants lost in our wood.” Sarah said.

Anne Eyore began “Do you know there are animals who are lost AND not fed?”

“No!” Sarah said, “I did not know!

Where are these animals who are neglected so?”

“Not 20 forests east there are hungry buffalo,

and 60 forests south there are lost dingo!”

“Oh d-d-d-dear!” Said Diglet “I will carry this knowledge forevermore.”

“Indeed you will.” Said Anne Eyore.



“Can you help us cross the river?” Sarah asked, “I’m sure you can quickly make a plan.”

“I will fell 40 trees and build the perfect dam!” Jim began.

“And will coat it 5 times over with tiny pebbles and sand.“

“How about we cut down just one.”  Said Anne.

“We can lay it across the river so it spans the dry land.”

They found a tree 40 feet long and 3 feet wide,

And soon after Sarah and Diglet were on the other side.
